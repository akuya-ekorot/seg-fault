## Navigate the Linux System Like A Pro.

### Objectives

- Move around the computer
- See what files and directories I have
- Specify the location of a file or a directory

### Notes

- the part of the os responsible for managing files and directories is called the file system.
- it organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also folders) which hold files and other directories.
- various commands are used to create, inspect, rename, copy, move and delete files and directories.
- Before you go anywhere, figure out where you are first. That sounds like something a monk would say.

  - when you're in the terminal, you can check where you are using the `pwd` command.
  - (which stands for 'print working directory')
  - Knowing where we are before running commands is important because most commands read and write files in the current working directory.
  - Here's an example of running `pwd` in your home directory.

  ```bash
  seg@fault: pwd
  /home/akuya
  seg@fault:
  ```
